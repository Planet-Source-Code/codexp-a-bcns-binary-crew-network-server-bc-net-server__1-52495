1. What is BC Net Server (BCNS) ?
   ------------------------------

  The full name is "Binary Crew Network Server".

  It is a Server that manages the BCNS Modules
  which will be shared for using by the Clients.

  Modules are ActiveX DLL Files. Those Modules can
  be loaded and unloaded by Server. Each of those
  Modules must have the BCNS Module Interface.

  The BCNS Module Interface provides some Procedures and
  Properties. Which can be used for Data exchange between
  the Module and the Client

  Commands to load and unload Modules on Server:

  Load Module:

  Syntax:
  |> modules load <mudule name>
  Example:
  |> modules load Comm
